# MNIST-digit-recognition
The K-Nearest Neighbours classification algorithm was used to implement and execute this project to recognize handwritten digits (0-9), which had an accuracy of 96%. The intended results were produced by first training the model to identify the handwritten digit using the MNIST train dataset and then testing the results using the MNIST test dataset.
